## 🚀 HOW TO USE YOUR SYSTEMS:

### Traditional ML System:
```bash
python run_demo.py                    # Local testing
python validate_aws_deployment.py     # Test AWS Lambda
```

### SageMaker AI System:
```bash
python deploy_sagemaker_ai.py         # Deploy & test foundation models
python test_all_granted_models.py     # Test all 4 models
```
